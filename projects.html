    <p class="p">This project was for my AP Computer Science Principles class. For this project, I had to find a tech innovation, and I chose to do my project on chatbots used in healthcare.For this project I had to find the purpose, function, beneficial effects, potential harmful effects, how it uses data, and the data concerns of chatbots. From this project I learned more about how we are using technology and what we are doing with it to improve our lives. </p>
